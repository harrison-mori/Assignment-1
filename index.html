    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <h2> Personal Information </h2>
    <p> I was born in Melbourne in 1998. My family background is Austrian and Italian. In 2016, I graduated from Wesley College and obtained my VCE. I have a Certificate II in Electrotechnology. I speak fluent English but would love to learn another language one day. I have a 6-month-old puppy named Loki. He is an American Staffy Cross, and we rescued him from the pound in February of this year. I am not sure Loki was the most appropriate name for him as this means “god of mischief”. Consequently, he is always up to no good. </p2>
